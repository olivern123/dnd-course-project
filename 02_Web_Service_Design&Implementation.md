# Blog Post 2 - Web Service Design & Implementation
During this phase we have implemented the backbone for our ESG waste management system by creating a .NET 8 Web API with database support using SQLite and a controller for handling waste data

## Working with our RESTful web API
We designed our application as a Web API using .NET 8 preset framework. The system is made to have clear routes for adding and getting data.

We have made:
- Entity Framework Core using SQLite which is our waste.db file used for storage.
- Swagger UI, this automatically generates live API documentation ensuring we have the right endpoints.
- Controller WasteMangementController.cs which exposes API endpoints.

## Overview of API endpoints
With our controller in place our API supports basic CRUD functions on waste data.
Examples like 
GET /api/wastemanagement
POST /api/wastemanagement
DELETE /api/wastemanagement/{id}

## File Storage with SQLite
Instead of using raw CSV files we opted to use SQLite to store all data in a single .db file in order to simplify the project.
